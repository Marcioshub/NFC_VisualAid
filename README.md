# NFC_VisualAid

Given the advancements we have made in terms of technology, the last people who benefit from them are the ones who really need it. Currently, there is a lack of help for the visually impaired students of Brooklyn College. For this reason, the purpose of this project to use a current, cheap and easily adaptable technology which aids the visually impaired students of Brooklyn College navigating inside the campus using NFC tags and a smart phone (android). At the moment this will only work for the second floor of Ingersoll hall.
